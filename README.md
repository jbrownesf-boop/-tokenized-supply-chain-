# 🧠 Tokenized Supply Chain Optimization

## 🚀 Overview
This project explores how blockchain technology and Python-based simulation can optimize supply chain transparency, traceability, and efficiency. As part of my pivot into financial engineering and fintech, I’m applying systems thinking to model tokenized asset flows and smart contract logic.

## 🎯 Purpose
Supply chains are vulnerable to fraud, delays, and data silos. By simulating tokenized asset tracking, this project demonstrates how decentralized finance (DeFi) principles can be applied to real-world logistics and operational strategy.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python**: Core simulation logic
- **Pandas & NumPy**: Data handling and analysis
- **Matplotlib**: Visualization of asset movement
- **GitHub Projects & Issues**: Agile planning and documentation
- *(Future)*: Smart contract logic via Solidity or IBM Blockchain Essentials

## 📈 Project Goals
- Simulate tokenized asset movement across supply chain nodes
- Visualize transaction flows and contract triggers
- Document business impact and scalability potential
- Build a foundation for future blockchain-integrated systems

## 🧭 Strategic Context
This repo is part of my public-facing fintech portfolio. I’m transitioning from manufacturing leadership into blockchain systems architecture, combining operational excellence with emerging financial technologies.

## 📚 Learning Milestones
- ✅ Python-for-Finance certification underway
- ✅ GitHub profile and roadmap established
- 🔄 Simulation logic in development
- 🔄 Smart contract integration planned
